# lancer-encounter-balancer
A tool that will provide feedback and balancing tips for a combat lineup for the TTRPG LANCER.

I don't know the first thing about Python yet, so this is going to be a heavy WIP, but I have some wonderful people that have offered to help me out.
This tool was inspired by the Encounter Balance worksheet that can be found in the PILOT NET discord's resources channel.

Ideally, this program will consist of a couple major chunks:
1. Read LCP files and import the appropriate data (Partially Complete)
2. Enable configuration of NPCs, as well as saving and loading them for future OPFOR linups (Partially Complete)
3. Analysis of strengths and weaknesses of OPFOR lineup to provide balancing tips
4. Analysis of OPFOR lineup to grade NPC combos that may skew the balance of combat in significant ways
5. Tips for players and GMs on how to navigate the combat configured

Eventually, I'd like to expand upon the tool to compare the same sort of details, but regarding the player mech lineup instead.
