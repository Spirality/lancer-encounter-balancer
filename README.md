# lancer-encounter-balancer
A tool that will provide feedback and balancing tips for a combat lineup for the TTRPG LANCER.

I don't know the first thing about Python yet, so this is going to be a heavy WIP, but I have some wonderful people that have offered to help me out.
This tool was inspired by the Encounter Balance worksheet that can be found in the PILOT NET discord's resourses channel.
